# Mobi Estimates — Client Portal

A self-service onboarding, project-submission, and estimate-delivery portal for
**Mobi Estimates** (M-O-B-I) — outsourced construction estimating for GCs, subs,
developers and builders.

> **Status: Milestone 1 — Foundation + app shell, now connected to a live
> Supabase project.** This folder holds the service-independent foundation
> (Supabase schema + RLS, env template, docs) **and** a runnable Next.js +
> Supabase app shell (auth, role-protected portal/admin layouts, middleware).
> The shell **type-checks (`tsc --noEmit`) and builds (`next build`) cleanly**.
>
> **Live Supabase project** `mobi-portal` (ref `kzgfcgzewmqwlxfadtgz`, org
> "Moni estimates", region us-east-1, free tier) has been created and the
> migrations applied: all 27 tables exist with RLS enabled, helper functions +
> policies + the signup trigger are in place (plus `0003` hardening: pinned
> `search_path` and revoked public EXECUTE on internal-only functions). The
> signup trigger was verified end-to-end — a new `auth.users` row auto-creates a
> `public.profiles` row with the default `client` role. Copy `.env.example` →
> `.env.local` with the project URL + anon key to run locally.
>
> **One value still to add:** `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (server-only secret,
> from Dashboard → Project Settings → API). It's only needed for the admin
> client / Stripe webhooks (Milestone 2+); auth and RLS work without it.
>
> **Note on this build environment:** the dev container's network egress is
> restricted, so a *running* dev server here cannot reach `*.supabase.co`
> directly (DB work above was done over the Supabase management API). Run the app
> locally or on Vercel, where egress is open, to exercise the live auth flow in a
> browser.

## Architecture decision (recorded)

The portal is a **separate Next.js + Supabase application deployed to Vercel** at
`portal.mobiestimates.com`. The existing marketing site stays on GitHub Pages and
links to the portal for Login / Create Account / Client Portal.

**Why not reuse the existing repo?** This repo (`stevens-transport-app`) contains
two unrelated things: a Next.js driver-application app for *Stevens Transport*, and
the static *Mobi Estimates* marketing site. The marketing site is static (GitHub
Pages) and **cannot run a backend**. A SaaS portal needs server runtime + Supabase
+ Stripe webhooks, so it lives in its own repo/host to keep concerns clean and easy
to hand to future developers. This `mobi-portal/` folder is the **seed** for that
new repo — extract it (`git subtree`/copy) into a fresh repo when ready.

**Stack:** Next.js 15 (App Router) + TypeScript · Supabase (Auth, Postgres, RLS,
Storage) · Stripe Checkout + Billing · Resend · React Hook Form + Zod · Tailwind +
shadcn/ui · Vercel. No GoHighLevel, no paid CRM, no hard-coded secrets.

## Why no app code yet (honesty note)

The build environment has **no Supabase/Stripe/Resend project and restricted network
egress**, so an app scaffold here could not be run, type-checked end-to-end, or
tested against real services. Per the brief ("do not claim something works unless it
was tested"), Milestone 1 first delivers the parts that are correct and verifiable
without live services: the **schema, RLS policies, env contract, and docs**. The app
scaffold (auth flow, protected portal shell, Stripe routes) is generated in the next
step against your provisioned keys so it's genuinely testable.

## Setup (when ready to run the app)

### 1. Supabase
1. Create a project at supabase.com. Copy URL, anon key, service-role key into `.env.local`.
2. Install CLI: `npm i -g supabase`. Link: `supabase link --project-ref <ref>`.
3. Apply schema + policies: `supabase db push` (runs `supabase/migrations/*`).
4. (Local dev only) load placeholders: `supabase db execute -f supabase/seed.sql`.
5. Storage: create **private** buckets `project-files` and `deliverables`; add the
   member/staff policies noted at the bottom of `0002_policies.sql`. Use signed URLs.

### 2. Stripe
1. Create one **Price** per plan (recurring monthly). Paste IDs into `.env.local`
   and/or the `plans.stripe_price_id` column.
2. Add a webhook endpoint → `https://portal.mobiestimates.com/api/stripe/webhook`,
   subscribe to: `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.created`,
   `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`, `invoice.paid`,
   `invoice.payment_failed`. Copy the signing secret to `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
3. The webhook handler verifies signatures and is **idempotent** (stores processed
   event IDs in `webhook_events`). Success-page redirects are never trusted as proof
   of payment.

### 3. Resend
Verify your sending domain, set `RESEND_API_KEY` and `EMAIL_FROM`.

### 4. Vercel
Import the portal repo, add all `.env` vars (mark `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` and
Stripe secrets as server-only / not `NEXT_PUBLIC_`), deploy, point DNS.

## Security model (enforced in `0002_policies.sql`)
- **Default-deny RLS** on every table; clients see only rows for companies they
  belong to; staff (estimator/reviewer/admin) see operational data across companies.
- **Never trust the frontend** — RLS is the source of truth; route guards are UX only.
- **Service-role key is server-only** (webhooks/admin); never shipped to the browser.
- **Private file storage** + short-lived signed URLs; no public file URLs.
- **internal_note** on the project timeline is hidden from clients (clients read the
  `client_timeline()` RPC / a client-safe view, not the base table).
- Stripe is the only place card data lives; passwords are handled by Supabase Auth.

## Roles
`client` · `estimator` · `reviewer` · `admin`. A company has many users; users are
linked via `company_members`. Bootstrap the first admin by adding your email to
`ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_EMAILS` (handled in the app's auth step) or by setting
`profiles.role = 'admin'` directly in Supabase.

## How to edit common things
- **Plans/prices:** `plans` table (or `config/plans.ts` defaults) — values are
  placeholders until OWNER_DECISIONS.md is confirmed.
- **FAQ / assistant knowledge:** `faq_entries` table (approved content only).
- **Training videos:** `training_modules.video_url`.
- **Agreement text:** `service_agreements` (versioned; acceptances are recorded).

## Launch checklist (high level)
- [ ] OWNER_DECISIONS.md completed
- [ ] Supabase migrations applied; storage buckets + policies created
- [ ] Stripe prices + webhook live and verified
- [ ] Resend domain verified
- [ ] Legal drafts reviewed by an attorney
- [ ] First admin user created
- [ ] Cross-company access test passes (client A cannot see client B)
- [ ] Stripe test-mode end-to-end: checkout → webhook → subscription active → onboarding

## Roadmap (milestones)
M1 foundation (this) → M2 Stripe/checkout/webhooks → M3 onboarding → M4 project
intake + files + validation → M5 admin dashboard → M6 questions + email → M7
deliverables + revisions + capacity → M8 FAQ + assistant + tickets → M9 security/
testing/deploy. Each milestone ends with lint, type-check, tests, and a summary.
