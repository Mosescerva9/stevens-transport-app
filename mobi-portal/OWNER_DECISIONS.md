# Owner Decisions — Mobi Estimates Portal

These are business/legal values **only the owner can supply**. The code uses
clearly-labeled placeholders until you fill these in. Nothing here is invented or
final. Reply with answers (or use the ChatGPT intake prompt) and they'll be wired
into config + the `plans` / `service_agreements` / `training_modules` tables.

> Rule we are holding to: no fabricated prices, stats, reviews, certifications,
> guarantees, phone numbers, or "unlimited / 100% accurate / guaranteed" claims.

## 1. Accounts to create (required before the app can run/be tested)
- [ ] **Supabase** project (free tier ok) → provides URL + anon key + service-role key
- [ ] **Stripe** account → secret key, webhook secret, one Price per plan
- [ ] **Resend** account + verified sending domain → API key
- [ ] **Vercel** account (deploy target) + connect the portal repo
- [ ] DNS: `portal.mobiestimates.com` → Vercel

## 2. Plans & pricing — APPROVED OFFER (authoritative)
The website and Stripe checkout use exactly this offer. The source of truth in
code is `src/lib/pricing.ts`. Three monthly subscription plans + one Pay Per
Project one-time option. Nothing more, nothing less. No free trial.

**Monthly plans** — new subscribers get **50% off the first month** (once),
then the regular monthly price beginning with month two:
- [x] Starter — **$995/mo** — first month **$497.50**
- [x] Growth (MOST POPULAR) — **$1,995/mo** — first month **$997.50**
- [x] Estimating Department — **$2,995/mo** — first month **$1,497.50**

**One-time option:**
- [x] Pay Per Project — **$199 per project**, one-time. Not a subscription; the
      50% first-month discount does NOT apply.

Still owner-supplied (do NOT invent — left blank until confirmed): per-plan
estimating capacity / active-project limits / turnaround / revision policy, and
whether unused monthly capacity rolls over. The pricing surface intentionally
advertises no capacity/limit/turnaround/guarantee numbers until these are set.
